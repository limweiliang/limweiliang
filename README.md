### ðŸ‘‹ Personal Introduction
---
- ðŸ’» Hi there, I'm Wei Liang, currently a Data Scientist at SAP.

- ðŸŽ’ I graduated with an honours degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore in 2023, and I was also part of the interdisciplinary University Scholars Programme!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m personally interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and most recently, my work has been focused largely on creating & evaluating LLM-based use cases. Here are some useful [resources](https://limweiliang.notion.site/LLM-Resources-to-Explore-1158ccfa158d80a09453dd1838d3d128?pvs=4) on working with LLMs that I've compiled over time. Happy reading!
